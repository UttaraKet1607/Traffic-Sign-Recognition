# Traffic-Sign-Recognition

There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.

Taking a step towards achieveing better accuracy in autonomous vehicles, a deep neural network model is developed that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories.

About the data:
1.   Multi-class classification problem
2.   More than 40 classes
3.   More than 50,000 images in total
4.   Large database
5.   Some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images
